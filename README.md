## üì∞ News

- [2025-06-12] We release our code.
- [2025-06-04] Our paper is accepted by Nuclear Fusion!

## üì¶ To be released

- Running demo
- And more, please stay tuned!

## üìã Overview

This repository contains the official implementation of our Nuclear Fusion paper "Physics-informed deep learning model for line-integral diagnostics across fusion devices". Our method incorporates physical information by a multiplication process and applies the physics-informed loss function according to the principle of line integration. This repository provides the detailed implementation of applying our methods on HL-2A and EAST datasets.

## üî• Highlights

- üîç We find that the additional input of physical information improves the deep learning model's ability.
- üîç The incorporation of the physics-informed loss function has been shown to correct the model's predictions, bringing the back-projections closer to the actual inputs and reducing the errors associated with inversion algorithms
- üì∏ We have developed a synthetic data model to generate customized line-integral diagnostic datasets.
- üí™ This study achieves reductions in reconstruction errors, and accelerates the development of surrogate models in fusion research.

  abstract = {Abstract             Rapid reconstruction of 2D plasma profiles from line-integral measurements is important in nuclear fusion. This paper introduces a physics-informed model architecture called Onion, that can enhance the performance of models and be adapted to various backbone networks. The model under Onion incorporates physical information by a multiplication process and applies the physics-informed loss function according to the principle of line integration. Prediction results demonstrate that the additional input of physical information improves the deep learning model's ability, leading to a reduction in the average relative error E\_1 between the reconstruction profiles and the target profiles by approximately 0.84{\texttimes}„Äñ10„Äó{\textasciicircum}(-2) on synthetic datasets and about 0.06{\texttimes}„Äñ10„Äó{\textasciicircum}(-2) on experimental datasets. Furthermore, the implementation of the Softplus activation function in the final two fully connected layers improves model performance. This enhancement results in a reduction in the E\_1 by approximately 1.06{\texttimes}„Äñ10„Äó{\textasciicircum}(-2) on synthetic datasets and about 0.11{\texttimes}„Äñ10„Äó{\textasciicircum}(-2) on experimental datasets. The incorporation of the physics-informed loss function has been shown to correct the model's predictions, bringing the back-projections closer to the actual inputs and reducing the errors associated with inversion algorithms. Besides, we have developed a synthetic data model to generate customized line-integral diagnostic datasets and have also collected soft x-ray diagnostic datasets from EAST and HL-2A. This study achieves reductions in reconstruction errors, and accelerates the development of surrogate models in fusion research.},
